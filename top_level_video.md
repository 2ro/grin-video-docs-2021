No one knows who Tom Elvis Jedusor is. But they had a vision for a new kind of blockchain in 2016.

They named it(the blockchain?) MimbleWimble. This new blockchain would be unlike any other that had existed. It would combine all transactions while keeping the blockchain's history reliably intact [INSERT 1 or 2 MORE DETAILS].

Like magic, the blockchain would be private by default while acheiving a smaller blockchain size than bitcoin ever could be [INSERT 1 or 2 MORE DETAILS].

A few months after the MimbleWimble concept was shared, a developer named Ignotus Peverell would begin work on GRIN.

With privacy at its foundation, GRIN promised peer-to-peer electronic cash: amounts would be hidden, addresses wouldn't be "on-chain", and transactions safely merged together in what would look like a single transaction.

Grin holds value because [reason]  -- its core principles are being Open, Private, Scalable, Simple and Proven. There's no company or foundation behind it, and no ICO, founder reward, pre-mine or dev-tax. The coin distribution is designed to be as fair (but not gratis) as is known to be possible.

In a world with increasing surveillance, thought policing and financial turbulence, GRIN aims to be [a bastion of monetary privacy](rewrite) not to be centrally controlled by any one business or government.
